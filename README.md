# State Bot

A Discord bot made for the State Discord server built with  [discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and application commands.  
This bot is restricted to the **State** Discord server only, hence unavailble for other servers.

- `/serverinfo` — Show information about the server.
- `/clear <channel> <limit>` — Delete a number of recent messages.
- `/purgeall <channel>` — Delete all messages from a channel.
- `/roles` — List all roles in the server.
- `/uptime` — Show how long the bot has been running.
